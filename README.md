# Dukk's Nix Config
Not quite a finished config just yet.

To install, simply clone the flake, and run (from the flake directory):
```sh
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake ".#nixos"
```

The old Windows config is available in the [`old-wsl`](https://github.com/DakshG07/nix-stuff/tree/old-wsl) branch.
